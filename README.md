## Dependencies

with pip in a single command (linux/macos) run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Differences with previous years

The code of this year uses the
[gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library instead of gym, which
was used in previous years. A good overview of the differences can be
found [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/migration-guide/).
