# RL_2023

Official Repository for the Reinforcement Learning Course at Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (Sapienza University of Rome).

Prof. Roberto Capobianco

TAs: Andrea Fanti and Michela Proietti

Here you will find the code used during practical lessons.

Please refer to the classroom page for further information.

## Dependencies

`requirements.txt` contains all the Python libraries needed to run the
notebooks, meant to be used with Python 3.8.*. To install all of them
with pip in a single command (linux/macos) run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or, locate/switch where the python.exe is located first.
```bash
myenv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Differences with previous years

The code of this year uses the
[gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library instead of gym, which
was used in previous years. A good overview of the differences can be
found [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/migration-guide/).
